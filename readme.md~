Social Bookmarking for Literature and Tech Class
Issues:

Not sure why the list it's adding on to doesn't correspond with the one the computer
currently is on. Don't understand this _.id

Make it so that lists aren't public and that you have to sign in in order to view lists
Make all lists automatically private first.
Have sharing feature where you can share lists with other people.
Think about how you want curations to be. Pinterest format may not be best for that
Understand what the code is doing in places where you're more uncertain
Do Meteor and JS tutorials
